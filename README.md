## About the project
The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is undertaking its Testbed-17 Innovation Initiative, a collaborative effort to rapidly prototype, design, develop and test solutions to location-related problems. Testbed-17 outcomes are expected to shape the future of geospatial software architectures, processing, and data handling. Testbed sponsors supported this vision with cost-sharing funds to partially offset the costs associated with development, engineering, and demonstration of these outcomes. These funds enabled participants to recoup a portion of their initiative expenses.
